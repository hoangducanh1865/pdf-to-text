1.1 Problem Statement In today’s industrial landscape, logistics plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth supply chain operations by facilitating the flow of goods from origin to destination.
Fundamental tasks such as stacking, unloading, and intra-warehouse movements are essential in this process, with the precise identification of warehouse object’sconditions being of utmost importance. Recent technological advancements, in cluding the widespread availability of cost-effective cameras and the successful implementation of computer vision, revolutionize logistics operations –. Theaffordability of cameras and sensors leads to their widespread use in many ware houses. These computer vision advancements enable accurate identification and tracking of objects, particularly pallets, within the logistics environment.
Pallets play a crucial role in the warehouse industry. They are wooden structures, as shown in Figure 1.1. These flat structures are used to support goods in a stable manner while being lifted by forklifts, pallet jacks, or other handling equipment.
Pallets make it easier to move, store, and organize products efficiently. Overall, pallets are essential for ensuring smooth and efficient operations in warehouses, leading to cost savings and improved productivity. Therefore, recognizing pallet conditions becomes an essential task in industrial automation.
The adoption of pallets revolutionized how warehouses operate. Before their invention, goods were typically stored in barrels, crates, or boxes, making them difficult to handle and organize. Pallets allowed for better organization, increased accessibility, and faster inventory turnover. Warehouses equipped with pallets caneasily load, unload, and rearrange products, ensuring that items are readily avail able for shipment and reducing valuable downtime. In the storage and warehousingsector, space optimization is critical for cost-effectiveness. Pallets facilitate effi cient use of vertical space through stacking, maximizing warehouse capacity by installing the racks as per the available space in both horizontally and vertically.
Pallets also simplify inventory management, as they provide a standardized unit to count and track items. As shown in Figure 1.2, pallets help forklift to stabilize the goods while they are lifted.
