According to statistics by April 2023  of NapoleonCat (a tool to measure social network indicators), the total number of Facebook social network users in Vietnam is nearly 85 million people, accounting for more than 83% of the country population, an increase of 30 million users compared to 2019 . Instagram social network with nearly 11 million people (June 2021), of which the audience is mainly young people, the age group 18-24 accounts for more than 30% of the total. In addition, it is impossible not to mention social networks with a huge number of users such as TikTok, Twitter, Telegram, etc.

On average, young Vietnamese users spend about 7 hours per day using social networks.
