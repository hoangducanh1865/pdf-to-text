1.1 MotivationThese days, the infinity development of Internet makes not only the vast of pos itive effects but also brings a large number of problems. The big problem of using network now is cyber attacks including DoS and DDoS attacks, Malware, Phishing attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, Password attacks, etc.
Malware (or Malicious Software) is any programs or files that intentionallyharmful to a computer, network or server. Malware can infect networks and de vices and is designed to harm those devices, networks and their users in some way depending on type of malware and its goal.
There have been many detect system for others attacks but not much for mal ware. As there are more types of malware appears, I personally think that it is necessary to improve the existing model to detect as many types of malware as possible. That the reason why I do this thesis.
1.2 Objectives and scope of the graduation thesisTraditionally, malware detection and classification has relied on pattern match ing against signatures extracted from specific malware samples. While simple andefficient, signature scanning is easily defeated by a number of well-known eva sive strategies. This fact has given rise to statistical and machine learning based techniques, which are more robust to code modification.
Malware is not very a complicated attacks but it leads to a vast of risky prob lems. Detecting malware soon in the cybersecurity is crucial and help decrease the negative impact.
I would like to train a model using Machine Learning and Deep Learning tech niques to detect and classsify malware attacks with a dataset cover as many types of malware as possible.
1.3 Tentative solution In this thesis, my goal is to compare Deep Learning for malware detection and classification. I will apply DL models using image-based features, and also opcodefeatures. The DL models consider include a wide variety of neural networking tech niques, including multilayer perceptrons (MLP), several variants of convolutional neural networks (CNN), and vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNN), as well as the advanced RNN architectures known as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU).
1I would like to use Python with skicit-learn and torch library for some reasons below:
Scikit-learn provides a user-friendly interface with a consistent API, making it accessible for beginners and easy to implement various machine learning Scikit-learn is highly compatible with other Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas, facilitating seamless data manipulation and analysisPyTorch excels in building and training deep learning models, such as convo lutional neural networks (CNNs), which are highly effective for image-based tasks PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, allowing for more flexibility and ease in building complex models and custom architectures Pytorch is suited for deep learning tasks, providing flexibility, powerful deep learning capabilities, and efficient training with GPU support In this work, I have built some modules including:
Module to convert binary file to image Module to extract features Module to extract opcode from image Module use ML and DL algorithms Module log to log write and save history 1.4 Thesis organization The remaining of Thesis report will be organized as below.
Section 2: I would like to represent about Theoretical basis about classification techniques such as the definition of cyber attacks especially malware, definition of techniques used in this thesis, and information about library used.
Section 3 is about how I build Model to detect and classify malware using above techniques and dataset. Furthermore, I would like to show some codes and explain them In Section 4, Result of model trained will be showed and evaluated by some criterions. I will also want to show my future work with this system to improve and widen it.
