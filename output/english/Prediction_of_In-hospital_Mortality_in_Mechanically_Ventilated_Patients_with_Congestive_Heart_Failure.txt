1.1 Problem Statement Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac abnormalities, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention. In 2021, HF was universally defined as a condition characterized by elevated levels of natriuretic peptides or evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion . Congestive heart failure (CHF), a more specific and advanced stage of HF, is characterized by significant fluid buildup and congestion. Due to its severity and complexity, CHF often requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission for management .
Mechanical ventilation, a critical life-support intervention, is frequently used in the ICU to manage CHF patients experiencing respiratory failure. Although life-saving, this intervention carries substantial risks, including hemodynamic instability, alveolar inflammation, and complications caused by altered intrathoracic pressures . These challenges highlight the urgent need for advanced predictive tools to assess patient outcomes, aiding more effective clinical decision-making and improving management for this high-risk group.
Predictive modeling is an indispensable tool in healthcare, offering the abilityto forecast patient outcomes based on clinical data, thereby enhancing decision making. For mechanically ventilated CHF patients, predictive models assist in identifying individuals who might benefit from early interventions, intensive monitoring, or alternative therapeutic strategies. However, predicting early mortality in this population remains challenging due to the intricate interplay of systemic organ dysfunction, comorbidities, and rapidly changing clinical conditions.
Traditional scoring systems, such as SOFA, APACHE-II, LODS, MODS, and SAPS-II, are significantly associated with mortality in critically ill patients and have demonstrated utility in mortality prediction . While the SOFA and GWTG-HF risk scores provide valuable insights, they have notable limitations. The SOFA score, for example, evaluates organ failure but lacks specificity for heart failure, whereas the GWTG-HF score captures HF-specific risks but insufficiently addresses systemic dysfunction. Additionally, these tools face challenges such as incomplete clinical data, including missing arterial blood gas measurements, and their static nature, which does not accommodate the dynamic changes in a patientâ€™s condition . Population variability and the need for interpretable, actionable predictions 1
