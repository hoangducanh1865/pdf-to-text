1.1 Motivation The motivation behind creating my web application stems from the increasinginterest and popularity of cryptocurrencies. As the cryptocurrency market contin ues to grow, there is a demand for accessible and user-friendly platforms to monitor and visualize the momentum factor in cryptocurrency data.
By developing this web application, I aim to provide users with an intuitiveand informative tool to track and analyze the momentum factor for different cryp tocurrencies. The ability to visualize the momentum data can help investors and enthusiasts gain insights into potential price movements and trends.
The significance of this project lies in its potential to democratize cryptocur rency data analysis. By making momentum factor visualization easily accessible to users, regardless of their technical background, I hope to contribute to a broader understanding of the cryptocurrency market and foster informed decision-making.
Moreover, the web application’s adaptability allows for potential use cases be yond the crypto domain. The visualization techniques and tools employed in thisproject can be extended to other fields where momentum analysis and data visual ization are relevant.
In conclusion, my web application’s primary objective is to provide a user friendly platform for visualizing the momentum factor in cryptocurrency data, fostering a better understanding of market trends and contributing to informed decision-making for investors.
1.2 Objectives and scope of the graduation thesisUnder the current market conditions, there is a noticeable absence of any ap plication specifically designed to visualize momentum data for cryptocurrencies.
Despite the growing interest and popularity of cryptocurrencies, there is a lack of user-friendly platforms that provide easy access to visualizing and analyzing the momentum factor for various crypto assets.
The absence of such applications highlights the significance and urgency of my graduation thesis. By developing a web application to fill this void, I aim to offer users an intuitive and informative tool for monitoring and understanding the momentum trends in the cryptocurrency market.
The primary objective of my thesis is to bridge this gap and provide investors1and enthusiasts with a dedicated platform that empowers them to make more informed decisions. By democratizing cryptocurrency data analysis and making momentum factor visualization readily accessible, my web application seeks to con tribute to a broader understanding of the cryptocurrency market and foster better decision-making for users with varying technical backgrounds.
1.3 Tentative solution In my project, I have made several decisions to achieve the outlined objectives.
Firstly, I chose to gather cryptocurrency data using the Coingecko API as it pro vides comprehensive and up-to-date information on various cryptocurrencies. This data is then stored on Github, ensuring a secure and easily accessible repository for further analysis.
Secondly, I implemented a momentum factor calculation algorithm to process the collected data. This algorithm allows me to assess the momentum trends and gauge the strength of price movements for different cryptocurrencies over time.
Furthermore, to predict future price movements, I utilized an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, a type of deep learning architecture well-suited forsequential data like cryptocurrency price history. The LSTM model can learn patterns and dependencies from historical data, enabling it to make informed predic tions about future price changes.
The primary contribution of my project is the development of a web application that showcases the momentum factor for various cryptocurrencies. By presenting this factor visually, the application aims to provide users with valuable insights into market trends, supporting them in making well-informed investment decisions.
