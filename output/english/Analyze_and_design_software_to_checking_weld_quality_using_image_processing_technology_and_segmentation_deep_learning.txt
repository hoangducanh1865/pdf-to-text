1.1 Overview PCB (Printed Circuit Board)( figure 1.1) is a multi-layer and non-conductive printed circuit board in which all the electronic components are connected togetheron a circuit board and with a base underneath. When there is no PCB, the compo nents are connected by wires, which increases the complexity and the reliability is not high, so it is not possible to create a circuit as large as the motherboard. In a PCB, all the components are connected wirelessly and are wired internally, thusreducing the complexity of the overall circuit design. PCBs are used for power sup ply and connections between components. PCB can customize any specificationsaccording to user requirements. You can encounter PCB in many electronic de vices such as: TV, mobile phone, digital camera, computer parts such as: Graphics card, Motherboard. . . It is also used in many fields. such as: Medical equipment, industrial machinery, automotive industry, lighting...
Figure 1.1: Circuit board (PCB) sample In the electronics industry, error checking on printed circuit boards (PCBs) is an important factor in ensuring product accuracy and safety. Currently, there are manytechniques and devices used for error checking on PCBs, including in-circuit test ing (ICT), X-ray inspection( figure 1.3), and automated optical inspection (AOI)( figure 1.2). These techniques allow for quick and efficient error detection during 1
