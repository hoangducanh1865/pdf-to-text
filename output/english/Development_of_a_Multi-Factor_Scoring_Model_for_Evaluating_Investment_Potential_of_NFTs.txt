1.1 Problem Statement The NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market has grown exponentially in recent years, creating significant opportunities for investors and collectors. NFTs, unique digital assets tied to blockchain technology, are valued based on a wide range of factors, including rarity, utility, market trends, and reputation. However, this rapidly expanding market is characterized by a lack of standardized and reliable evaluation frameworks, making it difficult for investors to assess the actual worth of NFTs. Current pricing mechanisms are highly subjective and often influenced by external factors such as social media hype, celebrity endorsements, and speculative activities, leading to significant price volatility and investment risks. Without a systematic way to evaluate NFTs, investors face uncertainty in determining which assets hold genuine long-term value and which are overvalued or part of speculative bubbles. Market inefficiencies exacerbate these challenges, as NFTs are often priced without a clear connection to their underlying utility or potential returns. Furthermore, existing studies and methodologies on NFT valuation remain limited, leaving investors with insufficient tools to make data-driven decisions. This research seeks to address these challenges by developing an optimized formula to evaluate and rank NFTs for investment purposes. The proposed formula incorporates critical factors such as return on investment (ROI), transaction volumes, buyer and seller activity, ownership distribution, and reputation scores. By integrating these metrics into a cohesive scoring system, the formula aims to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing NFT value. This approach not only empowers investors with actionable insights but also fosters transparency and efficiency within the NFT market, reducing speculative risks and encouraging informed decision-making.
1.2 Background and Problems of Research The rapid growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem has given rise to various digital assets, including NFTs (non-fungible tokens). NFTs, unique digital tokens representing ownership of a specific asset, have gained widespread popularity across multiple domains such as art, gaming, and collectibles. Despite their rapid adoption, the evaluation of NFT collections in terms of market performance, reputation, and user engagement remains a significant challenge. The absence of standardized labeling and ranking frameworks often leads to inconsistent assessments, making it difficult for investors and users to navigate the market effectively.
1One of the primary problems is the lack of systematic methodologies to classify NFT collections based on their performance metrics such as transaction volumes, number of buyers, sellers, and owners. While raw numerical data is readily available, its interpretation for meaningful insights remains problematic. Additionally, the influence of social media activity on NFT reputation and valuation has been recognized but is not systematically incorporated into ranking models. Metrics like likes, retweets, and tweets mentioning collections on platforms such as Twitter can provide valuable insights into user sentiment and engagement but require advanced computational methods for analysis.
Moreover, the volatility and dynamic nature of the NFT market exacerbate these challenges. Trends and market behaviors can shift rapidly, requiring continuous updates to ranking methodologies. The lack of a unified framework for assessing NFT collections creates an uneven playing field, leaving room for manipulation or biased assessments. These issues highlight the necessity for robust and scalable solutions that integrate quantitative performance metrics with qualitative indicators like social media influence.
This research aims to address these challenges by developing a comprehensivelabeling and ranking system for NFT collections. By utilizing ROI scores, quantile based classification, and social media data, the study seeks to establish a standardized framework that enables more transparent and reliable evaluations of NFT collections.
The work not only addresses the current gaps in NFT market analysis but also contributes to advancing methodologies in the broader field of blockchain-based asset evaluation.
1.3 Research Objectives and Conceptual Framework The primary objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive reputation scoring model for NFT collections by integrating both on-chain and off-chain metrics to assess their credibility, trustworthiness, and community engagement.
On-chain data such as trading volume, transaction frequency, unique buyers and sellers, and ownership distribution provide insight into the market activity and liquidity of NFT projects. Meanwhile, off-chain factors, including social media metrics like likes, retweets, and mentions, as well as community activity on platforms such as Twitter, offer a qualitative evaluation of public perception and community involvement. By combining these dimensions, this research proposes a hybrid reputation scoring algorithm that assigns weights to key metrics, balancing market activity with social credibility. The framework incorporates a validation phase to compare the calculated reputation scores against actual market performance and user sentiment, 2
