This chapter will introduce the practical challenges that motivated this research. It will then outline the goals and an overview of the proposed system solution.
1.1 Motivation In recent years, urbanization and population growth have led to a significant increase in demand for rental housing, especially in large cities. This trend has created challenges for both landlords and tenants in effectively managing the rental process. Landlords oftenstruggle with time-consuming tasks such as advertising properties, tracking rent pay ments, and managing tenant information. Meanwhile, tenants struggle to find suitable accommodation, understand rental terms, and ensure secure transactions.
Despite the growing demand, many rental management processes remain manual orrely on disparate, inefficient, and error-prone tools. These inefficiencies can lead to misunderstandings, late payments, and a lack of trust between landlords and tenants. A well organized rental management system is essential to address these challenges, improve efficiency, and foster trust.
If these issues are addressed, the benefits are enormous. Landlords can save time and effort, reduce errors, and improve the overall management of their properties. Tenants, on the other hand, can enjoy a more seamless and transparent leasing process. Beyond individuals, such a system could also benefit real estate companies, property managers, and other stakeholders in the rental market. Furthermore, the principles and features of such a system could be adapted and applied to other sectors, such as hotel reservations, office leasing, or event venue management.
1.2 Objectives and scope of the thesis Current rental management tools, such as online listing platforms and basic propertymanagement software, provide some support to hosts and tenants, but often lack inte gration, secure payment systems, and customized features for diverse user needs. Theselimitations result in inefficient workflows, limited transparency, and reduced trust be tween parties.
This thesis aims to address these issues by developing a comprehensive rental management system. Key features include secure payment processing, rental tracking, rolebased user management, and automated processes. The system will overcome the lim itations of existing solutions, improving efficiency, reliability, and transparency in the rental process.
By providing a modern and user-friendly platform, this project seeks to set a new 1
