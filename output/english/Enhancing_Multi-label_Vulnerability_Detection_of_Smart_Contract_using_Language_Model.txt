1.1 Problem Statement Blockchain  is a decentralized information storage and transmission technology, developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. This technology is used to confirm and store transactions and information online with high security. A blockchain is a chain of data blocks linked together using encryption and arithmetic algorithms to ensure data integrity. Each block contains information about transactions performed on the network and a hash code representing the previous block. This hash code will be used to confirm the integrity of the next block on the chain. With blockchain, data is stored on many different nodes on the network, without a single control center, so no one can tamper with the information and modify it easily. This makes blockchain a useful technology in many fields, including finance, healthcare, supply chains, and many others. Some applications of blockchain can include:
Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and many others are created on the blockchain platform. Cryptocurrencies allow users to exchange money without going through intermediary financial institutions.
Supply chain management: Blockchain is used to monitor the entire process of manufacturing, transporting, and storing products. This helps reduce paperwork and ensure transparency throughout the entire process.
Asset management: Blockchain provides a reliable solution for asset management, including traditional assets such as real estate, cars, cosmetics, and jewelry.
Online voting: Blockchain provides a secure and reliable solution for online voting, ensuring the integrity of election results.
File storage: Blockchain provides a decentralized file storage solution, ensuring data integrity and security.
Healthcare: Blockchain can be used to manage patient medical information, ensure the security and privacy of medical information, and help increase information sharing between health agencies.
Copyright management: Blockchain can be used to manage copyrights of many types of assets, including music, books, movies, and other creative products.
Financial management: Blockchain can be used to manage loans, loans, and other financial transactions, ensuring integrity and transparency in the transaction 1process.
Smart contract management: Blockchain provides a smart contract management solution that simplifies verifying and executing contracts while minimizing dependence on intermediaries.
Therefore, it can be seen that blockchain technology has many applications and development potential in many different fields. However, this technology also has vulnerabilities that are targets for bad actors to attack. In terms of cryptocurrency, there have been many attacks that have affected the financial economy. There are some well-known attacks:
51% Attack: An attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by a group of miners who control more than 50% of the network’s mining hash rate. Owning 51% of the nodes on the network theoretically gives the controlling parties the power to alter the blockchain. The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control. Reversing transactions could allow them to double-spend coins, one of the issues consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work were created to prevent. For example, in May 2018, Bitcoin Gold experienced a 51% attack that allowed the attacker to double-spend approximately %18 million worth of BTG. This event caused substantial damage to the coin’s reputation and market value.
DAO attack: An attack implemented in 2016 on the Ethereum system. The attacker has found a vulnerability in DAO’s smart contracts (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and used this vulnerability to steal more than 3,6 million Ethereum units (about $50 million at that time). This incident sparked a crucial discussion in the blockchain community regarding the safety of blockchain and the role of smart contracts.
Mt.Gox Attack: Mt.Gox used to be the world’s largest bitcoin exchange but eventually collapsed in 2014. The attackers found a vulnerability in their software and stole more than 850000 Bitcoins (about $450 million at that time). This attack is one of the most damaging attacks in blockchain history and has caused a lot of controversy about the safety of cryptocurrency exchanges.
Parity Wallet Attack: In 2017, a cyber attack targeted Parity Wallet, a widely used Ethereum wallet. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the wallet software and gained unauthorized access to users’ wallets, stealing over 150,000 Ethereum units, valued at approximately $30 million at the time.
